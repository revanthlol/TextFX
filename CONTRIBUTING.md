## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

    ```

    This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Setup Environment

To ensure a consistent development environment, please make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

It's recommended to use a Node.js version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to easily switch between Node.js versions.
